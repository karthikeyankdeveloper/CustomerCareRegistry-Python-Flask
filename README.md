Customer Care Registry Using Cloud Technology is an application used for providing services for an organization or management. The service is provided for the end users. The issues faced by the end users are solved by the Agents/Admin. In the existing application, a particular agent receives different kinds of issues in his single dashboard. Even though the agent doesnâ€™t know well about the issue, they need to solve that issue at the right time. And then, the status of the ticket is not shown to the customer. Whether the ticket has been closed or open is unavailable. Finally, the tickets are closed manually. This takes more manpower and time. We have initiated our proposed solution for the drawbacks of the existing application. The first solution is internal routing where the agent receives the ticket automatically from the customer's query using Machine Learning Concept. Then, the Status is shown to the Customer where the Customer gets the Status of the Individual Ticket Shown to the Customer. Also, the Customer can use Chat Assistance to get solutions for their queries.
